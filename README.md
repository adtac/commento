Commento is a discussion platform that you can self-host. You can embed it on your blog, news articles, and any place where you want your readers to add comments. Unlike most alternatives, Commento is lightweight and privacy focused; we'll never sell your data, show ads, embed third-party tracking scripts, or inject affiliate links.

### Features

 - Privacy focused
 - Modern interface with a clean design
 - Automatic spam filtering
 - Review and approve or delete comments through the moderation interface
 - Lightweight (under 10 KB total), allowing for faster pageloads
 - Import from existing services
 - Completely free and open source (MIT license)

### Editions

There are three editions of Commento:

 - **Commento Community Edition** (CE) is open source software that's freely available under the MIT Expat license.
 - **Commento Enterprise Edition** (EE) includes extra features geared towards organizations. If you're interested in this, [contact me](mailto:c.adhityaa@gmail.com).
 - [**Commento Hosted**](https://commento.io) is a service version of Commento if you want to embed Commento without running servers.  This is currently in private beta and you can [add yourself to the waiting list here](https://commento.io).

### Getting Started

#### Hosting the Backend

If you want to self-host Commento, you have three options:

##### Run Binary

Go makes deployment easy by producing a single binary. This is the recommended way, as it has the least amount of abstraction. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/adtac/commento/releases/latest) for your operating system and architecture, extract, and run. For example, if I'm on linux-amd64, I would do:

```bash
$ tar xvf commento_0.2.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
$ ./commento
```

This would expose the server on port `8080`. Point your Commento frontend configuration to this.

##### Use Docker

You can also use Docker to host Commento. A minimal Docker image is provided: [`adtac/commento`](https://hub.docker.com/r/adtac/commento/). You can get a container running by pulling the image and starting it to expose the server on port `8080`:

```bash
$ docker pull adtac/commento
$ docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 adtac/commento
```

##### Build from Source

Commento is written in Go. Build the binary from source and run the produced executable:

```bash
$ go build -i -v -o commento
$ ./commento
```

If you're building the project for the first time, `go build` might take a few seconds since Commento's dependencies need to be pulled and compiled as well. However, subsequent builds will be faster.

#### Frontend Integration

To embed Commento in your website, paste the following HTML snippet wherever you want Commento to load:

```html
<div id="commento"></div>
<script defer
  src="http://server.com/assets/js/commento.min.js"
  data-div="#commento">
</script>
```

Commento will simply fill the container it is placed in. Remember to change `server.com` to your server.

### Configuration

#### Configuring the Backend

| Parameter | Default Value | Meaning |
| --------- | ------------- | ------- |
| `COMMENTO_PORT` | 8080 | Default port on which the server will listen. |
| `COMMENTO_DATABASE_FILE` | `commento.sqlite3` | Database file that Commento will use to store comments. |
| `AKISMET_KEY` | | Your Akismet key. Read [our docs](docs/akismet.md) for more details on how to obtain one. |

Commento uses environment variables to configure parameters. You can either use a `.env` file or give parameters through the command line. For example, a particular configuration can be achieved in three different ways:

```bash
$ cat .env
COMMENTO_PORT=9000
COMMENTO_DATABASE_FILE=/app/commento.db
AKISMET_KEY=abcdef012345
$ ./commento
```

```bash
$ COMMENTO_PORT=9000 COMMENTO_DATABASE_FILE=/app/commento.db AKISMET_KEY=abcdef012345 ./commento
```

```bash
$ export COMMENTO_PORT=9000
$ export COMMENTO_DATABASE_FILE=/app/commento.db
$ export AKISMET_KEY=abcdef012345
$ ./commento
```

Note that environment variables have precedence over `.env` values. If you're using Docker, you can pass environment variables too:

```bash
$ docker run adtac/commento -it -d -p 9000:9000 \
    -e COMMENTO_PORT=9000                       \
    -e COMMENTO_DATABASE_FILE=/app/commento.db  \
    -e AKISMET_KEY=abcdef012345
```

### Purpose

If you run a blog, and you want your readers to converse, you'll probably install Disqus. After all, they're the biggest system, with 500 million unique visitors every month<sup>[[1]](https://blog.disqus.com/the-numbers-of-disqus)</sup>. They have a free plan, too! They also have non-optional advertisement, third-party tracking, affiliate marketing, and link hijacking <sup>[[2]](http://donw.io/post/github-comments/)</sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.cleversprocket.com/disqus-is-parsing-your-dom-and-adding-affiliate-links/)</sup> <sup>[[4]](http://chrislema.com/killed-disqus-commenting/)</sup> <sup>[[5]](https://medium.com/patrickleenyc/beware-of-disqus-17fb58cfab10)</sup>. Your readers will be mercilessly tracked, and you'll have no privacy whatsoever &mdash; even if you don't leave any comments. Thanks to the 90+ downloads Disqus will make, your website will be considerably slower.

Commento aims to solve this. Commento is [free software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software) that you can self-host for the cost of a cup of coffee. No third-party tracking scripts will be injected, there will be no affiliate marketing, no advertisements. Just comments.

While some open source solutions existed, I didn't find any attractive enough at the time Commento was created -- most were either they were discontinued or development was virtually non-existant. Free software is about, well, freedom, so I figured I'd write my own software.

### Contributing

Commento is possible only because of its community. The project is still in beta and I'd be thankful for any contribution. Please go through the [development guidelines](docs/development.md) before you start. If you're a newcomer, you want to go through our [newcomer docs](docs/newcomers.md) first. Pick up any issue and hack away!

If you have any questions, [please ask in our `#commento` IRC channel on freenode](https://irc.commento.io).

### Sponsors

Commento development is sponsored by [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org) and [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) independently.
